    <h1>Brotien Shake</h1>
    <p>Most of you <strong>DWEEBS</strong> drink protien shakes and expect to double in size, unfortunately this is not the case most of the time. In this recipe I will highlight a key industry secret used for decades at the highest levels of professional sport. This is one you wont want to miss out on</p>

    <p><strong>You guessed it!</strong></p>
    <p>The secret ingredient is a dash of Peach Schnapps, this changes the chemical composition of the amino acids within the protiens and transforms it into <em>BROTIEN</em> which is key for muscle growth as brotien is absorbed into the bloodstream much faster than protien </p>

    <p>
        Follow the simple steps below and you will be fighting with a T1000 in no Time!

        <li>Pour some cherry juice into a blender</li>
        <li>Slice up one banana and add to blender</li>
        <li>Add whey protien of your choice, I reccomend using Agatha Christies deep red blood for this step</li>
        <li>Add a dash of Peach Schnapps, half a litre should be enough for this recipe</li>
        <li>Attach blender to the exoskeleton of a mecha-jesus and put setting to <strong>OBLITERATE</strong></li>
